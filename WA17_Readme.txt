WA17 Majerle STOLport, Duvall, Washington for Microsoft Flight Simulator

Created by: Denny Atkin

WA17 Majerle STOLport is a small airfield on a farm just north of Duvall, WA, a suburb in the foothills east of Seattle. It’s a small grass strip mowed out of farmland. In fact, it’s currently closed, as the Majerle family sold the farm and the new owner hasn’t kept up the strip maintenance. However, in our Flight Simulator world we prefer to keep it open as it’s a beautiful base from which to explore up and down the scenic Snoqualmie Valley. Head south to Fall City to see Snoqualmie Falls (from Twin Peaks), or North to Monroe, do a touch-and-go at First Air, and then fly East through the mountains.

The AI-generated WA17 had significant issues, the biggest of which were tall trees at the end of the runway (which aren’t there in reality) that made it extremely difficult to land on. Also, the grass runway wasn’t visible at all, when in fact the lighter color from the mowed field makes it very visible from the air. These were corrected, and some objects were added to give the area more life. (Including a couple of Easter eggs for Duvall residents.) 

To see a real life landing and takeoff at WA17, check out John Marzulli’s video on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k41s7dpNpU4

The scenery additions and tree placements were made using Bing maps, as well as Mr. Marzulli’s video, as a guide. All objects are standard MSFS objects; I hope to eventually update this with custom buildings that more closely match the real-life buildings there.
